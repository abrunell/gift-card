User-entered Field Validation.

    GiftCard:
        Starting balance:
            --Between 0.00 and 50.00
                This gets redundantly handled by HTML requirement and Validator.
            --No extra decimals.
                Handled redundantly by HTML requirement and setter logic.
            --No text or other characters
                Handled redundantly by HTML requirements, and an exception throw.
            --Not null.
                Handled by Validator. Could also be handled by HTML requirement, but I like the specificity of the
                    Validator message.


    Card transactions:
        Card Number:
            --Must not be null.
                Handled by HTML requirement.
                > Need to implement backend solution.
            --Must exist in the database.
                Handled by an IllegalFieldValuesException.

        Transaction amount:
            --Must not be null.
                Handled by HTML requirement.
                > Need to implement backend solution.
            --No extra decimals.
                Handled redundantly by HTML requirement and setter logic.
            --Must be numeric only.
                Handled by HTML requirement.
                > Need to implement a backend solution.
            --Cannot exceed the remaining balance on a card.
                Handled by setter logic.
            --Negative transactions can't take care beyond initial balance.
                !!!!! Need to implement this !!!!!


    Customer:
        Names:
            --(Names don't have any validation. Pretty much anything goes, as the names aren't required, or used for
                any logic).
        Phone:
            --Must be 10-digits.
                Handled by an IllegalFieldValuesException.
            --Must not be already in-use.
                Handled by an IllegalFieldValuesException.
            --Must be numeric only.
                Somehow this is being handled by Validator??????? I do not understand why Validator is flagging this,
                    given how I have it set up. Need to come back and figure this out.

    Registration:
        Phone number:
            --Must exist in the Customer database.
                Handled by an exception.

        General:
            --Card can't already be registered (at the moment, though this is planned to change.)
                Handled by IllegalFieldValueException. (Not the right exception for this really, but it's just temporary)
